# Vittorio
An artillery duel clone in compiled BASIC. 

The game is written entirely in BASIC. It will run in the interpreter, but very slowly. The build script in build compiles it using the MOSpeed BASIC compiler: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2

It generates two output files (which can be found in the build directory as well), called vittorio.prg and vittorio-c.prg. They are both functional identical, but the -c variant has been compressed after compilation.

If you just want to play the game, you can find pre-build PRG files in the build directory as well.
